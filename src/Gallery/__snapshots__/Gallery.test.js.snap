        This is one the first image I took of any sort of insect. After being able to see how much detail that was visible in the image versus the naked eye, I decided to try taking more of the small critters that roam the earth.

        I have always thougth it's always been cool to see the Moon during the day, and so I took a picture. It maybe common photo to find on the web, but it's still cool to see the craters so clearly when it's from a photo you took.

        Took this photo from across the room using a longer lens. I was amazed to also see how much detail was able to be captured. I was also able to free the bugger from my house.

        This is nice shot of a downhill street in my neighborhood that faces the mountains. However I would say it looks a lot nicer when actually there.
