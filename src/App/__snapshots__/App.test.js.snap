          This is one the first image I took of any sort of insect. After being able to see how much detail that was visible in the image versus the naked eye, I decided to try taking more of the small critters that roam the earth.

          This is nice shot of a downhill street in my neighborhood that faces the mountains. However I would say it looks a lot nicer when actually there.
